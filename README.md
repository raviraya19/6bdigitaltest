6b Digital Test

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `_s`, or `6bdigitaltest`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

### Rquirements
PHP, MySql
TailwindCSS 
VanillaJS
Node v18, npm v9
Parcel for taking build

### Setup

This project uploaded whole WoredPress Code files.

Originally this project used https://localwp.com/ tool, feel free to use any other tool.

Clone this project to your local, change the wp-config.php settings to connect your database. This projects inclues all the plugins and uploads.

Plugins:
    - ACF Pro
    - SVG Support

- Activate the plugins
- Activate the themes (6bdigitaltest)

```sh
Make sure you imported the DATABASE
```

After go the theme directory to run the builds - wp-content/themes/6bdigitaltest/

install node and all the dependenacies using below command:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run watch

```

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

### Database 
You can find the database in "database" directory to import.

### WP admin

- In the pages you can fine home page as front end selected.
- Used Gudenburg Block for Hero Slider
- Used WP menu to mange the header nav - Appearence->menu
- There is General Settings Option on the admin nav to change the logo, CTA's etc...
